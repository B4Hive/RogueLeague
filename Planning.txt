# **RogueLeague Project**

## 1) Intro:


    A turn-based single player game made with the goal of "simulating" the experience of a MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena).

    Made fully on Java, using Swing as engine for GUI (just because I want but maybe make it a terminal game instead at least at first).

    Obviously not a MOBA game, since it'll be a single player game.

    Closest category for this would likely be a made up category, a Singleplayer offline battle arena, so SOBA (feeling hungry yet?).


## 2) Gameplay Plans:


    My plans (that may change while I develop it) are to make the gameplay function as following:

    The player selects a character from the roster (or makes a character, I'm still not fully sure about this part).

    Said character spawns into a corner of the arena (player base).

    A single AI enemy spawns on the oposite corner of the arena (enemy base).

    A few objectives (towers) are spawn in between the 2 bases.

    Those objectives will be considered "enemies" for both the player and it's AI enemy.

    Defeating said objectives will grant the one who defeated them a new ally.

    Once defeated, the objectives will respawn after a set amount of turns.

    If the player or one of it's AI allies find an enemy AI, they'll enter combat.

    After losing a fight a character will be inactive for a set amount of turns before respawning at their respective base.

    The combat and movement will all be turn based, with the player having the first action.

    Each enemy will enter the action order in the same order of their first spawn.

    At each action, the player must choose an action between moving, attacking and using an ability.

    Each ability is a set of combined effects, including always at least one instant effect and one lasting effect.

    Instant effects are those that just take effect in the turn they are used.

    Lasting effects are those that apply a repeating effect on the target for a set amount of turns.

    The mandatory lasting effect for every ability is the ability's cooldown.

    When a character deals the last hit on a combat (even if against an objective) they'll gain experience.

    Said experience will, at specific thresholds, increase the character's combat capabilities and status.

    The objective of the main game mode is to gather enough allies and group them at the enemy base for a set amount of turns.

    Each base has the special effect of healing it's corresponding characters.

    Enemy/Ally AI will move semi-randomly towards the Player/Enemy base (one step towards the base every 5 turns).

    When ally/enemy character has it's health points reduced to a specific point, they'll attempt to escape combat going towards their base.



## 3) Program Structure:

###    Engine Class:

        Manage the gameplay by getting the player's inputs and calling the required methods to return the results of said action.

###    Screen Class:

        Display the current state of the arena, with the character's positions, information (abilities) and status.

        Read the player's inputs directly and deliver them to the engine, as well as printing the results on screen.

###    MapGrid Class:

        Stores the map's layout, as well as the list of characters on the map.

###    Entity Class:

        Has the character's Status (HP,MP, XP, LV, etc.), a list of the character's abilities and a list of the effects currently active. Also has the current active map info.

        The necessary methods for combat and movement are on this class.

        The secondary objectives are considered entities.

###    CharacterLocator Class:

        Stores current active map and which characters are on it for collision and interaction reasons.

###    Ability Class:

        Stores a list of every character's abilities, as well as their respective effects.

        Has the necessary methods for damage/healing/effect calcs.

        Has subclasses:

            Damage: meant to reduce an enemy's health points;

            Healing: meant to restore an ally's health points;

            Debuff: meant to apply a negative effect to a enemy;

            Buff: meant to apply a positive effect to a ally;

###    Effect Class:

        Stores the types of effects.

        Has the methods for applying, removing and triggering each type of effect.

        Has subclasses:

            DoT: damage over time;

            HoT: healing over time;

            Enhance: increase specific stat;

            Diminish: decrease specific stat;

            Displace: forces the target's movement;

            Stun: prevents the target's movement;

            Shield: prevents damage;

            Wound/Inhibit/Cripple/Injury: prevents healing;

###    Data Class:

        Handles the management for the game data, such as loading and saving the data on external files.



## 4) Versioning:

###    Plan:


    0.1) Map Class/Entity Class/CharacterLocator:

        0.1.1) Map Generation and Info Getters in order to print it;

        0.1.2) Movement with template entity;

        0.1.3) Collision effect with a boolean return in order to facilitate future features;

    0.2) Abilities/Effect Class: Drafting the Ability types (subclasses); Filling out the required methods for skill casts/calc;

        0.2.1) Filling in the required methods for each effect type including duration settings;
        
        0.2.2) Making template Effect Abilities (Basic X : X -> Effect Subclass + Instant Effects);
